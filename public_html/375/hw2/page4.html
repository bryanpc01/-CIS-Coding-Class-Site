<p>  
Simpkin came away from the shop and went home, considering in his mind. He found the poor old tailor without fever, sleeping peacefully.
</p>
<p>
Then Simpkin went on tip-toe and took a little parcel of silk out of the tea-pot, and looked at it in the moonlight; and he felt quite ashamed of his badness compared with those good little mice!
</p>
<p>
When the tailor awoke in the morning, the first thing which he saw upon the patchwork quilt, was a skein of cherry-coloured twisted silk, and beside his bed stood the repentant Simpkin!
</p>

<p class="figleft"><a href="../../images/hw2ebook/52.jpg"><img src="../../images/hw2ebook/52-tb.jpg" alt="Back to the Shop" title="Back to the Shop" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>

<p>
"Alack, I am worn to a ravelling," said the Tailor of Gloucester, "but I have my twist!"
</p>

<p>
The sun was shining on the snow when the tailor got up and dressed, and came out into the street with Simpkin running before him.
</p>

<p>
The starlings whistled on the chimney stacks, and the throstles and robins sang--but they sang their own little noises, not the words they had sung in the night.
</p>
<p>
"Alack," said the tailor, "I have my twist; but no more strengthâ€”nor time--than will serve to make me one single button-hole; for this is
Christmas Day in the Morning! The Mayor of Gloucester shall be married by noon--and where is his cherry-coloured coat?"
</p>
<p>
He unlocked the door of the little shop in Westgate Street, and Simpkin ran in, like a cat that expects something.
</p>

<p>

But there was no one there! Not even one little brown mouse!
</p>
<p>
The boards were swept clean; the little ends of thread and the little silk snippets were all tidied away, and gone from off the floor.
</p>



<p>
But upon the table--oh joy! the tailor gave a shout--there, where he had left plain cuttings of silk--there lay the most beautifullest coat and embroidered satin waistcoat that ever were worn by a Mayor of Gloucester.
</p>

<p class="figleft"><a href="../../images/hw2ebook/57.jpg"><img src="../../images/hw2ebook/57-tb.jpg" alt="No More Twist" title="No More Twist" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>

<p>
There were roses and pansies upon the facings of the coat; and the waistcoat was worked with poppies and corn-flowers.
</p>

<p>
Everything was finished except just one single cherry-coloured button-hole, and where that button-hole was wanting there was pinned a scrap of paper with these words--in little teeny weeny writing--
</p>

<p>
NO MORE TWIST
