<h2 class="center">THE TAILOR OF GLOUCESTER</h2>
<h3 class="center">Page 2</h3>
</header>
<p>
Now all day long while the tailor was out at work, Simpkin kept house by himself; and he also was fond of the mice, though he gave them no satin for coats!
</p>

<p>
"Miaw?" said the cat when the tailor opened the door. "Miaw?"
</p>

<p>
The tailor replied--"Simpkin, we shall make our fortune, but I am worn to a ravelling. Take this groat (which is our last fourpence) and Simpkin, take a china pipkin; buy a penn'orth of bread, a penn'orth of milk and a penn'orth of sausages. And oh, Simpkin, with the last penny of our fourpence buy me one penn'orth of cherry-coloured silk. But do not lose the last penny of the fourpence, Simpkin, or I am undone and worn to a thread-paper, for I have NO MORE TWIST."
</p>

<p class="figleft"><a href="../../images/hw2ebook/20.jpg"><img src="../../images/hw2ebook/20-tb.jpg" alt="Asleep by the Fire" title="Asleep by the Fire" width="300" height="300"/></a></p>

<p>
Then Simpkin again said, "Miaw?" and took the groat and the pipkin, and went out into the dark.
</p>

<p>
The tailor was very tired and beginning to be ill. He sat down by the hearth and talked to himself about that wonderful coat.
</p>

<p>
"I shall make my fortune--to be cut bias--the Mayor of Gloucester is to be married on Christmas Day in the morning, and he hath ordered a coat and an embroidered waistcoat--to be lined with yellow taffeta--and the taffeta sufficeth; there is no more left over in snippets than will serve to make tippets for mice----"
</p>

<p>
Then the tailor started; for suddenly, interrupting him, from the dresser at the other side of the kitchen came a number of little noises--
</p>

<p>
_Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip!_
</p>

<p>
"Now what can that be?" said the Tailor of Gloucester, jumping up from his chair. The dresser was covered with crockery and pipkins, willow pattern plates, and tea-cups and mugs.
</p>

<p class="figleft"><a href="../../images/hw2ebook/23.jpg"><img src="../../images/hw2ebook/23-tb.jpg" alt="Under the tea-cup" title="Under the Tea-Cup"  width="300" height="300"/></a></p>

<p>
The tailor crossed the kitchen, and stood quite still beside the dresser, listening, and peering through his spectacles. Again from under a tea-cup, came those funny little noises--
</p>

<p>
_Tip tap, tip tap, Tip tap tip!_
</p>

<p>
"This is very peculiar," said the Tailor of Gloucester; and he lifted up the tea-cup which was upside down.
</p>

<p class="figleft"><a href="../../images/hw2ebook/24.jpg"><img src="../../images/hw2ebook/24-tb.jpg" alt="Lady Mouse" title="Lady Mouse"  width="300" height="300"/></a></p>

<p>
Out stepped a little live lady mouse, and made a curtsey to the tailor!
Then she hopped away down off the dresser, and under the wainscot.
</p>

<p>
The tailor sat down again by the fire, warming his poor cold hands, and mumbling to himself----
</p>

<p>
"The waistcoat is cut out from peach-coloured satin--tambour stitch and rose-buds in beautiful floss silk. Was I wise to entrust my last fourpence to Simpkin? One-and-twenty button-holes of cherry-coloured twist!"
</p>

<p>
But all at once, from the dresser, there came other little noises:
</p>

<p>
_Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip!_
</p>

<p>
"This is passing extraordinary!" said the Tailor of Gloucester, and turned over another tea-cup, which was upside down.
</p>

<p class="figleft"><a href="../../images/hw2ebook/27.jpg"><img src="../../images/hw2ebook/27-tb.jpg" alt="Gentleman Mouse" title="Gentleman Mouse"  width="300" height="300"/></a></p>

<p>
Out stepped a little gentleman mouse, and made a bow to the tailor!
</p>

<p>
And then from all over the dresser came a chorus of little tappings, all sounding together, and answering one another, like watch-beetles in an old worm-eaten window-shutter--
</p>

<p>
_Tip tap, tip tap, tip tap tip_!
</p>

<p>
And out from under tea-cups and from under bowls and basins, stepped other and more little mice who hopped away down off the dresser and under the wainscot.
</p>

<p class="figleft"><a href="../../images/hw2ebook/28.jpg"><img src="../../images/hw2ebook/28-tb.jpg" alt="More Mice" title="More Mice"  width="300" height="300"/></a></p>

<p>
The tailor sat down, close over the fire, lamenting--"One-and-twenty button-holes of cherry-coloured silk! To be finished by noon of
Saturday: and this is Tuesday evening. Was it right to let loose those mice, undoubtedly the property of Simpkin? Alack, I am undone, for I have no more twist!"
</p>

<p>
The little mice came out again, and listened to the tailor; they took notice of the pattern of that wonderful coat. They whispered to one another about the taffeta lining, and about little mouse tippets.
</p>

<p>
And then all at once they all ran away together down the passage behind the wainscot, squeaking and calling to one another, as they ran from house to house; and not one mouse was left in the tailor's kitchen when Simpkin came back with the pipkin of milk!
</p>

<p class="figleft"><a href="../../images/hw2ebook/31.jpg"><img src="../../images/hw2ebook/31-tb.jpg" alt="Simpkin is back" title="Simpkin is back"  width="300" height="300"/></a></p>

<p>
Simpkin opened the door and bounced in, with an angry "G-r-r-miaw!" like a cat that is vexed: for he hated the snow, and there was snow in his ears, and snow in his collar at the back of his neck. He put down the loaf and the sausages upon the dresser, and sniffed.
</p>

<p>
"Simpkin," said the tailor, "where is my twist?"
</p>

<p>
But Simpkin set down the pipkin of milk upon the dresser, and looked suspiciously at the tea-cups. He wanted his supper of little fat mouse!
</p>

<p>
"Simpkin," said the tailor, "where is my TWIST?"
</p>

<p class="figleft"><a href="../../images/hw2ebook/32.jpg"><img src="../../images/hw2ebook/32-tb.jpg" alt="Hiding the Twist" title="Hiding the Twist"  width="300" height="300"/></a></p>

<p>
But Simpkin hid a little parcel privately in the tea-pot, and spit and growled at the tailor; and if Simpkin had been able to talk, he would have asked: "Where is my MOUSE?"
</p>

<p>
"Alack, I am undone!" said the Tailor of Gloucester, and went sadly to bed.
</p>

<p>
All that night long Simpkin hunted and searched through the kitchen, peeping into cupboards and under the wainscot, and into the tea-pot where he had hidden that twist; but still he found never a mouse!
</p>

<p>
Whenever the tailor muttered and talked in his sleep, Simpkin said
"Miaw-ger-r-w-s-s-ch!" and made strange horrid noises, as cats do at night.
</p>


<p>
For the poor old tailor was very ill with a fever, tossing and turning in his four-post bed; and still in his dreams he mumbled--"No more twist! No more twist!"
